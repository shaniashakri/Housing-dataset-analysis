# Housing-dataset-analysis

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to a data cleaning project focused on the Nashville Housing [Dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx). The project aims to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and other data quality issues using SQL queries.

The Nashville Housing dataset contains information about real estate transactions, including property addresses, sale dates, sale prices, and other relevant details. By cleaning and organizing this data, the project seeks to facilitate further analysis and insights into the Nashville real estate market.

**Inspiration:** This project was inspired by the work of [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst), however, the code and additional functions implemented are unique to this project.

### Key Objectives:
- **Standardize Data Format**: Convert date formats to a standardized format for consistency.
- **Populate Missing Values**: Fill in missing property addresses and other relevant information.
- **Split Address Fields**: Separate property addresses into individual components like address, city, and state for better analysis.
- **Normalize Categorical Data**: Convert categorical variables like "SoldAsVacant" from 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' for clarity.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate records based on specified criteria.
- **Calculate Additional Metrics**: Calculate additional metrics such as sale price categories or appreciation rates if applicable.
- **Explore Further Data Cleaning Opportunities**: Continuously identify and address any other data quality issues as they arise during the analysis process.


_This README will be updated as the project progresses and additional insights are derived from the cleaned dataset. Stay tuned for further updates!_
